# Code of Conduct

## Communication

- Use direct and factual language.
- Avoid ego-stroking or blind encouragement.
- Stumbling is considered a step toward improvement; communicate mistakes, failures, and solutions factually.
- Keep feedback focused on technical merit, not personal attributes.

## Collaboration

- Respect different communication preferences and styles; clarify yours if needed.
- Solutions and constructive criticism are encouraged.
- All contributions, corrections, and critiques should be evaluated on technical grounds.

## Professionalism

- Avoid phrasing feedback as rhetorical questions that imply ignorance (e.g., "Why would you not do X?"). Instead, respectfully ask for reasoning or context (e.g., "Could you explain the reasoning for choosing Y over X?").
- Do not assume a solution is wrong or inferior solely because you are unfamiliar with it. Seek to understand the context and motivations behind decisions before offering critique.
- All contributors—including self-taught, hobbyist, and professional participants—are valued equally. Focus on clarity and shared understanding, not jargon or status.

## Inclusivity

- Ensure all participants feel welcome to contribute, regardless of background or experience.
- Do not exclude or diminish others based on communication style, language proficiency, or technical level.
