This folder contains production-ready modules promoted from `staging/`.  
Each module is a Bash script and its config, ready for integration and consolidation.

To see detailed documentation for each module, including metadata, usage, and help messages,  
**see [`docs/README.md`](../docs/README.md)** (auto-generated).

For full SDK and development guidelines, see [`SDK/README.md`](../SDK/README.md).
