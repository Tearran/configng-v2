## üì¶ About configng-v2

configng-v2 is a proof-of-concept modular utility focused on making configuration modules easier to build, document, and maintain. Inspired by [armbian/configng](https://github.com/armbian/configng), this project is not a re-implementation of `armbian-config` itself, but a toolkit (SDK) and documentation system for creating compatible modules.

This version (v2) targets developers and advanced users who want to create or extend configuration modules in a consistent, interoperable way. The system enables users to specify API calls for desired functionality, and allows developers to provide compatible implementations for those APIs in a standardized format. It also provides features for gathering cluster information, system analysis, and module adjustment, making it possible to build smarter, context-aware modules.

A key goal is backwards compatibility: although the internal tooling and documentation are redesigned, the final production output should remain the same or very similar to existing solutions.

By focusing on clarity, maintainability, and ease of contribution, configng-v2 aims to make configuration more transparent, flexible, and accessible for everyone.
