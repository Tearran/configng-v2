  <strong>Armbian Config: V3 (configng V2)</strong><br>
  <br>
</p>

## Overview

**armbian-config** is a system configuration tool for Armbian-based systems. It provides a straightforward, interactive environment for users to configure and manage system settings.

The tool supports both command-line interfaces (CLI) and text user interfaces (TUI), catering to a range of usage scenarios and user preferences.

## Scope and Responsibilities

- **armbian-config operates only in image-space.**  
	It is used exclusively on a running Armbian system and does **not** participate in the image build process. It does **not** affect image creation or customization at build time.

- **Image build changes belong to the build scripts.**  
	If you wish to change the default contents, packages, or configurations included in an Armbian image before it is built, those changes must be made in the Armbian build scriptsâ€”not in armbian-config.

- **Limit feature requests and bug reports to image-space actions.**  
	Feature requests or bug reports for armbian-config should only involve tasks that can be changed or applied on a running system. Requests relating to image creation or build-time customization should be directed to the Armbian build system.

## Goals

- **Migrate and Refactor:**  
	Transition legacy code and features into a standard, modern development structure.

- **Enable Testing:**  
	Facilitate robust unit and integration testing for all modules and helpers.

- **Support Automation and Multiple UIs:**  
	Clean separation of backend configuration from interface logic to allow for both automation and various user-facing interfaces.
