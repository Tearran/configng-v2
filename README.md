## ðŸ“¦ About configng-v2

configng-v2 is a proof-of-concept modular utility for metadata-parsed documentation (outputting to `md` and `json`) and system configuration, inspired by [armbian/configng](https://github.com/armbian/configng). It features redesigned metadata usability for user-friendly documentation clarity, scaffolding for easier module development, validation for maintainability, and an open approach to contribution. The goal is to make configuration more transparent, easier to document, and simpler for anyone to extend.
