  <strong>configng-v2: Next Generation Armbian Configuration<br></strong>
  <br>
</p>

## Overview

**configng-v2** is a modular Bash framework for configuring Armbian-based systems.  
It is the intended successor to [armbian/configng](https://github.com/armbian/configng), designed for maintainability, flexibility, and robust CLI/TUI usage.

> **Reference:**  
> The recommended module scaffold is [tools/00_setup_module.sh](tools/00_setup_module.sh).

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  Each configuration area (network, system, services, etc.) is handled by a standalone module. Modules follow a unified CLI interface and can be invoked independently or by the main dispatcher.
- **Helper Scripts:**  
  Reusable logic is factored into helpers (`_helper_*.sh`) to maximize code reuse and maintainability.
- **Consistent Option Parsing:**  
  All modules use the pattern: `modulename.sh [option] [arguments]`, and provide a help message with usage instructions.
- **Runtime (Image-space) Focus:**  
  All actions are performed on the running system only.  
  No code in configng-v2 customizes system images at build time; for that, use [Armbian's build scripts](https://github.com/armbian/build).
- **Tab-Indented Bash:**  
  Code style is consistent and function-firstâ€”tabs for indentation, clear function blocks, minimal global logic.

---

## Current State

- Core dispatcher and scaffolding are established ([tools/00_setup_module.sh](tools/00_setup_module.sh)).
- Sample modules (e.g., `module_webmin.sh`) demonstrate the new structure and conventions.
- CLI and TUI interfaces are under active development.
- Modules and helpers are being migrated from [armbian/configng](https://github.com/armbian/configng) and refactored for clarity and testability.

---

## Roadmap

- **Migrate and Refine:**  
  Gradually migrate legacy modules, update option parsing, and add new features as needed.
- **Testing:**  
  Integrate automated and manual tests for all modules and helpers to ensure reliability.
- **UI Separation:**  
  Clean separation of backend logic and CLI/TUI UI to support scripting, automation, and alternative frontends.
- **Documentation:**  
  Each module provides self-contained help output (see example below), and project documentation is updated as interfaces evolve.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Coding Style:**  
  Bash and sh scripts use tab indentation, not spaces.  
  Modules and helpers are minimal, function-oriented, and easy to read.
- **Naming:**  
  Modules: `<feature>.sh`  
  Helpers: `_<helper>_<feature>.sh`
- **Module Scaffold Reference:**  
  Use [tools/00_setup_module.sh](tools/00_setup_module.sh) as the template for new modules.
- **Help Output:**  
  Each module must provide accurate, clear help output using the pattern above.

## Scope

- **Image-space Only:**  
  configng-v2 is for configuring a running Armbian system.  
  Build-time changes belong in [armbian/build](https://github.com/armbian/build) or similar tools.
- **Feature Requests & Bugs:**  
  Limit requests to runtime (image-space) features and bugs.
