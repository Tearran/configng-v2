Minimal Netplan renderer switcher for configng-v2. Set or check the current Netplan renderer (NetworkManager or networkd) for all interfaces.

## About
Provides a simple interface to toggle or display the Netplan network renderer. Does not manage service installation or enablement.

## Usage
~~~bash
Usage: network_manager <command>

Commands:
	NetworkManager    - Set Netplan renderer to 'NetworkManager'
	networkd          - Set Netplan renderer to 'networkd'
	status            - Show current Netplan YAML and renderer
	help              - Show this help message

Examples:
	# Set the renderer to 'networkd'
	network_manager networkd

	# Set the renderer to 'NetworkManager'

Notes:
	- Only 'NetworkManager' and 'networkd' are supported renderers for this module.
	- Requires root privileges to modify /etc/netplan/*.yaml.
	- The renderer is changed by editing the first .yaml file found in /etc/netplan.
	- The Netplan CLI (netplan) will be used to apply changes if available.
	- If Netplan CLI is not found, you may need to apply changes manually.
	- Keep this help message up to date if commands change.
