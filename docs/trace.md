# trace
Lightweight timing and trace message utility for Configng V2 modules.

## About
Provides timing, tracing, and progress utilities for Bash modules. Supports trace timing and elapsed time reporting for module development and diagnostics.

## Usage
~~~bash
Usage: trace <option> | <"message string">

Options:
	help	- Show this help message
	<string>	- Show trace message (if TRACE is set)
	reset	- (Re)set starting point for timing
	total	- Show total time since reset, then reset

Examples:
	# Start a new timing session
	trace reset

	# Print elapsed time with a message
	trace "Step 1 complete"

	# Show total elapsed time and reset
	trace total

Notes:
	- When TRACE is set (e.g., TRACE="true"), trace outputs timing info.
	- Elapsed time is shown since last trace call.
	- Intended for use in config-ng modules and scripting.
	- Keep this help message in sync with available options.
