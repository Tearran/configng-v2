	disable <service>        - Disable the service (prevent start at boot)
	enable <service>         - Enable the service (start at boot)
	enabled <service>        - Test if the service is enabled
	mask <service>           - Mask the service (prevent all starts)

	service start ssh

	# Check if ssh is enabled and print a message
	service enabled ssh && echo "ssh enabled"

Notes:
	- All commands should be run as root or with appropriate permissions.
	- 'active', 'enabled', and similar commands return 0 for true, nonzero for false.
	- Commands that alter services (start, stop, enable, etc.) will not execute inside containers if systemd is not running.
	- This module is intended for use with the config-v2 menu and scripts.
	- See systemctl(1) for additional options and details.
	- Keep this help message up to date if commands change.
