Helpers for bulk packages operations (install, remove, upgrade, etc.)

## About
Provides helpers for managing multiple package at once via apt and dpkg. Intended for use by configng-v2 core logic and scripts.

## Usage
~~~bash
Usage: package <command> [package_name(s)]

Commands:
	update             - Update APT package lists
	upgrade            - Upgrade all installed packages
	full-upgrade       - Perform a full system upgrade (may remove obsolete packages)
	install <pkgs>     - Install one or more packages
	remove <pkgs>      - Remove and autopurge one or more packages
	configure <pkgs>   - Configure unpacked but unconfigured packages
	installed <pkg>    - Test if a package is installed (returns 0 if present)
	help               - Show this help message

Examples:
	# Install nano
	package install nano

	# Check if nano is installed and print a message
	package installed nano && echo "nano is installed"

Notes:
	- All commands use apt and require root privileges.
	- 'installed' returns success (0) if the package is present, nonzero otherwise.
	- Use quotes for multiple package names: package install "pkg1 pkg2"
	- This module is intended for use with the config-v2 menu and scripts.
	- Keep this help message up to date if any commands change.
