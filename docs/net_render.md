Notes:
	- Only 'NetworkManager' and 'networkd' are supported renderers for this module.
	- Requires root privileges to modify /etc/netplan/*.yaml.
	- The renderer is changed by editing the first .yaml file found in /etc/netplan.
	- The Netplan CLI (netplan) will be used to apply changes if available.
	- If Netplan CLI is not found, you may need to apply changes manually.
	- Keep this help message up to date if commands change.
