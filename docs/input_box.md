# input_box
Prompt the user for input using whiptail, dialog, or shell fallback; reads prompt from argument or stdin and prints result to stdout.

## About
This helper displays an input box for user input in TUI environments using dialog, whiptail, or a shell fallback. The prompt message can be supplied as a positional argument or piped via stdin. If no prompt is provided, usage help is shown. Supports ARM and x86-64 architectures on Debian, Ubuntu, and Armbian systems (kernel 5.15+). Useful for scripts needing interactive input with fallback and help options.

## Usage
